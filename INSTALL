                     How To Build Your Focus Kernel
                     ==============================


1. Prerequisits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Although is should be possible to build the kernel under other
environments, the source distribution is rather Unix-oriented. The kernel
should build pretty much out-of-the-box under Linux, and building under
other Unix-like operating systems shouldn't be too hard.

* Make utility - Your best bet is the GNU make utility. If you don't have
  this, you get if from <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>. Other 'make's
  could work, but may require tweaking of the Makefiles.

* C compiler - SDCC, a freeware, retargettable, C compiler is recommended,
  see <http://sdcc.sourceforge.net>. Although none of the language
  extensions this compiler offers are used, I have no idea what other
  compilers will produce.

* Assembler - SDCC comes with the required assembler software. For other
  compilers, you may well need another assembler.

* Linker - Again, SDCC comes with it's own - other compilers/assemblers
  may need another.

* Archiver - The 'ar' program, which is supposedly standard in most Unix-
  like systems.

* hex2bin utility - The version used during development is available from:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/hex2bin/


2. Kernel Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The current method of configuring the kernel is to edit 'config.h' (in
the root directory of the source distribution) manually. See the comments
in the file for details.


3. Editing Makefile.config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The chances are you're going to want to edit some of the settings in here,
especially if you're using a C compiler other than SDCC. In any case,
check the various macros are set how you need them. More details can be
found in the file's comments.


4. The Build
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you're using the software listed above, just typing 'make' should
compile the required sources and generate your kernel image. If you're
using other software, just hit 'make' anyway and see what happens - you
may need to edit the Makefile.config. If you end up with a working set of
Makefiles for a make utility other than the GNU version, please send it
on so it can be included in the distribution (see the README for contact
info).

The kernel image is called 'focus.bin', and should appear in the root of
the distribution. How you get this onto your own hardware is beyond me,
and also the scope of this document.


5. Running Focus on a Spectrum Emulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The compiled focus.bin file is a drop-in replacement for the ZX Spectrum
ROM. Most emulators supply several ROM files for different machines, so
you may wish to replace one of the more obscure versions with your own
kernel image.

For development, I find it's handy to put the emulator software on a
Samba shared directory, then make a symlink with the same name as the
ROM file to focus.bin. This way, when the kernel is updated, the new
verison can be tested on the emulator by simply resetting it. Note
however that not all emulators reload the ROM file when reset, so you
may need to restart the emulator itself.

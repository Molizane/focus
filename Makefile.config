#
# This is the bread and butter of the build system. Here we define all
# manner of macros, targets and whatever in order to automate the build
# as much as possible. In most cases, you can add a directory to the
# tree, put some sources in there, and Makefile.config will handle the
# rest. This default behaviour can be overridden by creating a file
# named "Makefile.dir" in your source directory containing local macros,
# targets and/or dependencies (see below).
#
# The basic process is that all source files in a directory get compiled,
# and the resulting object files are archived together to form a library.
# By default the library has the same name as the directory containing
# the sources (with an extension of ".a"), but this can be overridden by
# defining "$LIB" in "Makefile.dir". The files which will be copiled and
# eventually archived can be specified by defining "$SRCS" (for C source
# files) and "$ASMSRCS" for assemble language.
#
# The process is also recursive - by default, the Makefile of the current
# directory is copied into its subdirectories, and make is run in each
# one. Override by defining "$SUBDIRS".
